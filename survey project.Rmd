# Introduction

This project analyzes factors affecting mental health treatment decisions among tech workers.

# Data Cleaning

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
survey <- read_csv("survey.csv")
survey_clean <- survey %>%
  filter(Age > 18, Age < 65) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))
```

# Exploratory Analysis

```{r}
ggplot(survey_clean, aes(x = family_history, fill = treatment)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

# Logistic Regression

```{r}
# Model training
model <- glm(treatment ~ Age + family_history + benefits + care_options + anonymity + leave + supervisor,
             data = survey_clean, family = "binomial")
summary(model)
```

# Evaluation

```{r}
library(ROCR)
# ROC curve and AUC code here
```

# Conclusion

We found that workplace factors such as benefits and leave policy significantly impact whether employees seek mental health treatment.
